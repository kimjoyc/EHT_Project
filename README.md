1 GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS.
To finish the semester, we would like you to either further develop the SCF program you wrote
for CNDO/2 or the non-iterative extended Huckel method that you developed, or write some-
thing entirely new. Here is your chance to go beyond structured homeworks and exercise
your creativity in some scientific programming! This should be the equivalent of 1-2 home-
work sets in terms of effort, but we know different people have different time constraints, so
we’ll work with you to try to make sure that you are choosing something achievable.
We do want each of you to produce something that you are proud of, that reflects what
you’ve learned throughout the degree so far, and takes you further. Also, since this class has
had problem sets that build cumulatively on each other, by building further with the project,
you may even be able to take your code and use or further develop it in Prof. Demmel’s par-
allel computing class next semester!
Here is the schedule for our class project:
1. November 18: Select a topic, in consultation with Jiashu and myself – see choices be-
low.
2. December 7: Preliminary progress report. This will be a 10 minute discussion with
Steve and myself on December 7 to describe your initial progress and plans.
3. December 15: Present your theory, design, code, tests, and results to the class in a 20
minute talk, allowing at least 5 minutes for questions. We will do presentations on Dec.
15 and possibly the day before, and conceivably the day after...

2 CHOOSING A PROJECT.
The main idea of the project is for you each to do something different and individual. The
topic can be something drawn from the class topics, or an extension of them. Ideally it should
be something that interests you, and makes you want to go further! A list of potentially suit-
able topics are given below. They are not all equally difficult, so a rough estimate of how many
homework sets each one is equivalent to is given. Regardless of the level of difficulty, we will
award bonus points for outstanding achievements in the project! You can either choose one
of the topics below, or use the list to get you thinking about your own project suggestion. Re-
gardless, we want everyone to have their own project, so once a topic is selected by someone,
it will no longer be available.

4. Extend your Huckel code to include the pairwise atomic corrections needed to obtain
high accuracy for hydrocarbons (see the paper by Voityuk posted under reading ma-
terial), and implement the gradient. Get some results and compare to your CNDO/2
code for accuracy of structures and relative energies.
